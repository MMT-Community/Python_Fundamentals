# Python Programming Fundamentals

This comprehensive guide outlines key concepts in Python programming, providing a solid foundation for beginners and a useful reference for experienced developers.

1. Variables and Data Types
   - Concept: Variables are named references to stored data values
   - Python's dynamic typing system
   - Common data types: 
     * Numeric: int, float, complex
     * Sequence: str, list, tuple
     * Mapping: dict
     * Set: set, frozenset
     * Boolean: bool
   - Type conversion and checking (isinstance(), type())

2. Basic Operations
   - Arithmetic operations: +, -, *, /, //, %, **
   - Comparison operations: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
   - Logical operations: and, or, not
   - Assignment operations: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, etc.

3. Control Flow
   - Conditional statements: if, elif, else
   - Loops: for loops (with range, iterables) and while loops
   - Loop control: break, continue, else clause in loops
   - Comprehensions: list, dict, and set comprehensions

4. Functions
   - Defining and calling functions
   - Parameters: positional, keyword, default, variable-length (*args, **kwargs)
   - Lambda functions and higher-order functions

5. Data Structures
   - Lists: ordered, mutable sequences
   - Tuples: ordered, immutable sequences
   - Dictionaries: key-value mappings
   - Sets: unordered collections of unique items
   - Advanced operations: slicing, unpacking, methods specific to each structure

6. Exception Handling
   - Try-except blocks for handling errors and exceptions
   - Multiple except clauses and exception hierarchies
   - Finally clause for cleanup actions
   - Raising 

7. File Handling
   - Opening, reading, writing, and closing files
   - Text vs. binary mode
   - File object methods and attributes
   - Context managers (with statement) for automatic resource management
   - Working with CSV, JSON, and other file formats

8. Modules and Packages
   - Importing built-in and third-party modules
   - Creating and organizing code into modules
